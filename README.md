# MAL Tournament V 0.2

This is a program that pits the anime series in a user's myanimelist.net account against each other
in an effort to determine the scores for those series.

The program offers a GUI since version 0.2

To run the program, download the jar file generated by the latest master build and run:

    java -jar lib-0.2.jar
    
This should do the trick
