# MAL Tournament V 0.1

This is a program that pits the anime series in a user's myanimelist.net account against each other
in an effort to determine the scores for those series.

Currently, the best way to do so is to use the interactive CLI that asks the user to choose between
two series to determine which of these shows is better. If a discrepancy between this decision and the
current scores is detected, the user will be asked to check the scores and maybe change them.

To run the program, download the jar file generated by the latest master build and run:

    java -jar lib-0.1.jar
    
This should do the trick
