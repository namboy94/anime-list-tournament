MAL Tournament tracks some non-identifiable user behaviour data. Currently, the following is tracked with the help
of google analytics:

    - Every time a new screen is displayed, this change is sent to the analytics servers.
      It sends the name of the newly opened screen

More analytics gathering methods are currently in planning, however not yet implemented.
Such future changes will be added to this privacy statement as well as displayed in the changelog file

    http://gitlab.namibsun.net/namboy94/mal-tournament/raw/master/CHANGELOG


The application does NOT collect any PERSONAL data, including the myanimelist.net username and password.

In case an application build without the analytics tracking enabled is required/desired, there is an application
build available at https://github.com/namboy94/mal-tournament/releases, named

    mal-tournament-android-release-noanalytics-<version>.apk
